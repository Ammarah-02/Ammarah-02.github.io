Islam is a monotheistic religion that originated in the 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula. It is one of the largest religions in the world, with over 1.8 billion followers, known as Muslims. Islam is based on the belief in one God, referred to as Allah in Arabic. The religion was founded by the Prophet Muhammad, who is regarded by Muslims as the final messenger in a long line of prophets that includes figures like Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus.

The core teachings of Islam are found in its holy book, the Quran, which Muslims believe to be the literal word of God as revealed to Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel. Alongside the Quran, the Hadith—collections of the sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad—play a significant role in guiding Muslim practice
