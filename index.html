                    Hello and welcome to my personal blog! I’m Ammarah, a Computer Science student on a spiritual quest, with a heart set on building a deeper connection with my Lord and Creator.
                    This blog is my space to reflect on my spiritual journey — the joys, the struggles, and the beautiful lessons I learn along the way. From exploring my faith to sharing personal experiences and insights, I hope to inspire others to seek their own connection with their Creator.
                    
                    I believe that life is a journey of growth, guided by faith, love, and a profound sense of purpose. Whether it’s my daily reflections, favorite verses, or reflecting on Allah's creations, you’ll find it all here.


                    I invite you to join me as I walk this path — let’s explore, learn, and draw closer to our Creator together!

                    I love exploring new tech, diving into my religion, and finding calm through meditation. Each of these interests adds something special to my life, keeping me curious and centered.
