            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
         <p>Hello! I'm Ammarah, a Computer Science student with a passion for things like writing, coding, photography, meditation and so much more. This blog is a place where I can share my thoughts, experiences, and learnings with the world.</p>

            <h3>My Background</h3>
            <p>
                I’m a Muslim girl who was born and raised in South Africa. After spending about 14 years there, I moved to Pakistan to settle in my father's homeland. Now, I'm focusing on my studies and mapping out my future in the IT field.

            <h3>My Interests</h3>
            <p>
                In addition to my passion for IT, I’m deeply focused on building a strong connection with my Creator. I’m eager to dive deeper into His Divine Book, the Quran, to enrich my spiritual journey and understanding.
