        <h2 class="semi-transparent-background">Our Story</h2>
        <p class="semi-transparent-background">Founded in 1995, Ocean Basket has become a household name in South Africa, known for our commitment to serving high-quality seafood in a casual, family-friendly setting. With our roots deeply planted in Mediterranean cuisine, we offer a variety of dishes that celebrate the flavors of the sea.<br>
       From our humble beginnings in Pretoria, we've grown into a global brand, with over 200 restaurants in 16 countries. Despite our growth, we remain dedicated to our core values: providing great food at great prices, with a focus on sustainability and community.</p>
